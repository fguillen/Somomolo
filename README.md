Somomolo is a small minigame to challenge your memory skills.

Try to find what element was no present in the previous combination, if you fail the sequence will start from the beginning.

It is a very simple game but it can become tricky specially if you have to re-initiate a sequence. It will be challenging to keep the concentration and to not be mixed by your memory trying to figure out if this element was shown in the previous combination or in very previous one.
