## Day -360 .. time ago: inspiration

I was in a trance session playing another delicious game from Rusty Lake called [Samsara Room](https://rustylake.itch.io/samsara-room) and I was specially hoocked by one of its micro puzzles where 3 eggs are in a nest and when you break them 3 birds appeared, then after an apparent random session of clicks I found the pattern: you have to click in the one that was not there before. To better understand check [here](https://youtu.be/x1m_HTuLRo4?t=861).. I loved this puzzle and since them I wanted to make a full spin off based on it.

So that is it, this is the mechanic:

1\. Several elements are shown 
2\. 1st click allows to be in any element
3\. Elements disappear and new ones appear
4\. One of them was not in the previous iteration
5\. Click on the new one and you go back to point 3\.

If you fail you go back to the very beginning

It is a pure memorization game, on the orbit of Simon.


## Day 1 2021-01-21: It has a name

Inspired by this humorous, but brilliant, tutorial from @struthless about ["How to start a Podcast (in 4 steps)"](https://youtu.be/qMwe0A4AADE?t=45) I was playing with words that where related to:

- newcommer
- visit
- visitor
- new participant

Going through the synonymous and rhyme words I found one I like it: 

- entrant

Which looks like it means "person who enters a competition", great, this is it.. now I have to give it some hook, some punch, some beat.. So the tool that @struthless is cleverly using on his video came very helpful and I found a word that rhymes with "entrant" and also gives it the perfect personality: "unrepentant". Looking to the dictionary it means "making no apologizes", which I like it, because the "entrant" symbol has a lot of chances to remain in the group.

And the final title is: 

- The Unrepentant Entrant

It is a bit difficult to pronounce but I like it [how Mariska says it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WvFP_ClCNAyC33QsdKN2aS6UwrCuJfoL/view?usp=sharing)

## Day 2 2021-01-22: Prototyping

Uhm, what I need for a minimal prototype? I would like to have a version that is minimal playable so I can start testing the concept with real people that can offer me feedback. 

As this game is ultra simple I would like the art to be catching, funny and interesting, so the Player is not only interested in beating the game but also curious about about what the next graphic will be unveiled. So the first prototype should include this intention, minimal graphics but with some attractiveness.

This is what I came from:
