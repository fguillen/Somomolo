## Day -360 .. time ago: inspiration

I was in a trance session playing another delicious game from Rusty Lake called [Samsara Room](https://rustylake.itch.io/samsara-room) and I was specially hoocked by one of its micro puzzles where 3 eggs are in a nest and when you break them 3 birds appeared, then after an apparent random session of clicks I found the pattern: you have to click in the one that was not there before. To better understand check [here](https://youtu.be/x1m_HTuLRo4?t=861).. I loved this puzzle and since them I wanted to make a full spin off based on it.

So that is it, this is the mechanic:

1\. Several elements are shown 
2\. 1st click allows to be in any element
3\. Elements disappear and new ones appear
4\. One of them was not in the previous iteration
5\. Click on the new one and you go back to point 3\.

If you fail you go back to the very beginning

It is a pure memorization game, on the orbit of Simon.


## Day 1 2021-01-21: It has a name

Inspired by this humorous, but brilliant, tutorial from @struthless about ["How to start a Podcast (in 4 steps)"](https://youtu.be/qMwe0A4AADE?t=45) I was playing with words that where related to:

- newcommer
- visit
- visitor
- new participant

Going through the synonymous and rhyme words I found one I like it: 

- entrant

Which looks like it means "person who enters a competition", great, this is it.. now I have to give it some hook, some punch, some beat.. So the tool that @struthless is cleverly using on his video came very helpful and I found a word that rhymes with "entrant" and also gives it the perfect personality: "unrepentant". Looking to the dictionary it means "making no apologizes", which I like it, because the "entrant" symbol has a lot of chances to remain in the group.

And the final title is: 

- The Unrepentant Entrant

It is a bit difficult to pronounce but I like it [how Mariska says it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WvFP_ClCNAyC33QsdKN2aS6UwrCuJfoL/view?usp=sharing)

## Day 2 2021-01-22: Prototyping

### The MVP

Uhm, what I need for a minimal prototype? I would like to have a version that is minimal playable so I can start testing the concept with real people that can offer me feedback. 

As this game is ultra simple I would like the art to be catching, funny and interesting, so the Player is not only interested in beating the game but also curious about about what the next graphic will be unveiled. So the first prototype should include this intention, minimal graphics but with some attractiveness.

### The first Art

This is what I came from:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fguillen/TheUnrepentantEntrant/main/Art/Devlog/2021-01-22%20PlaceholdersBrainStorm.jpg

On the right there are plenty of placeholders ideas. The Placeholder is the structure that will serve are frame for the symbols. On the left we have some ideas of symbols for the Toaster placeholder. 

In the placeholders we can see examples like:

- Toaster: the symbols will appear jumping from the inside of the toaster
- Meteor: symbols will be different kind of aliens
- Magician hat: will will see rabbits and mysterious things
- Human brain: what can popup from the inside of an human brain? :)

From the first placeholder, the one I am going to use for the prototype (the Toaster) we have these kind of symbols ideas:

- Normal toast
- Toast with tomato, with cheese, with nutella .. uhmm
- A croissant
- A ballet dancer .. why not?
- ...

## Day 3 2021-01-24: Changing the name

So, if I have decided that the game was going to be named "The Unrepentant Entrant" why is "Somomolo" everywhere? the reason is that I was not sleeping well in the night, I was thinking the name and it was not fitting at all with the vibe I wanted to add to the game. The game is going to be very light weighted, very casual, something juicy and without complications. A name like "The Unrepentant Entrant" evoques more like an epic story, some kind of deep story adventure. 

My brain was itching me and I started a new brainstorm by myself focusing in finding a nonsense, stupid, funny and friendly name. Without any serious research I was navigating around these kind of names: 

- Mololoco
- Molololo
- Malotico
- Sumomomo
- Solomolo

They were the conjuction of 2 4 letters words making one. I like the rythmic of these words how funny they are to pronounce, I also like they are sort and nonsense. 

At the end I chose "Somomolo" without any real reason, I just like it :)

## Day 4 2021-02-09: The Mood Board

To help me to decide what kind of final art style I would like to add to the game I was following the advice of "getting inspiration" from other artists. This is a very funny part of a project because it is so nice to feel amazed by other artists and their work. At the beginning I was using Google Images and making a lot of copy paste and creating albums. But little by little I was trap by Pinterest, I was really trying to avoid to use Pinterest because I didn't like their aggresive politic of making you create an account to just browse around the images but at the end took the bite and make an account and now I am very happy with it. I really like the functionality is has to go from one image to other similar to it. Following this path I find very inspirational art.

I am creating this Mood Board:

I really would like to use very clean black lines illustrations. I decided that I need some color to make my life a bit easier with the illustrations
